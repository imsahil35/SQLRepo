select * from rgm where name like "s%"; --selecting a name where the name starts with the letter "s". "%" ddenotes all the letters "_" denotes the first letter or one letter
select * from rgm where name like "sa%"; --like is used to check the names or any attribute or column in the database..
select * from rgm where name like "%l";

select * from rgm where name not like "s%"; --not like gives the result which is not present in the databse for example a name which doesnt start with the letter "a"..

select * from rgm where session = "pyhton" Or session = "c"; -- we can use "or" and "in" which can be used in the same way. Both givess the same output...

--Distinct is used to represent the differrent set of values/marks which are present in the column...
select distinct marks from student;

--Count method is used to count the no of values and return the number...
select count(distinct stu_marks) from student;

--Limit method is used to limit the values upto particular extent if there are more values... in the example we have limited the address with 2 so it gives the output as first 2 values containing the address...

--Group by is used to group the columns into one and to specify the count the no of oocurence of each particular address..
